Cache::FastMmap::CImpl
===========================

The main C implementation of the cache is in mmap_cache.c.
CImpl.xs is the XS wrapper to expose it to perl.
mmap_cache_test.c is a basic set of tests for the cache
library. You can compile/test it with:

  gcc -DDEBUG -g mmap_cache.c mmap_cache_test.c
  ./a.out

It's pretty slow because it tests the integrity of the
entire page after each operation

INSTALLATION

This should automatically be installed as part of Cache::FastMmap
