Revision history for Perl extension Cache::FastMmap.

1.15  Thu May 8 17:12 2006
  - catch and rethrow die/exceptions in get_and_set() callbacks
  - avoid undef warnings when using cache_not_found mode
  - use unique tempfile name rather than the same every time
  - add allow_recursive option to allow calls to cache
    from within a read/write callback sub
  - add checks to die if we try and lock a cache twice,
    rather than just causing mysterious errors
  - add unlink_on_exit to automatically delete the share_file
    when the cache exits. default to true if we created
    the share_file, false if we connected to an existing one
  - make empty_on_exit only call empty if the pid of the
    process we're cleaning up in is the same as the pid we
    were created in
  - die in CLONE, making it clear threads aren't supported

1.14  Thu Oct 20 11:45 2006
  - alter calc_expunge to allow more efficient alternate
    implementation cases

1.13  Thu Oct 20 11:15 2006
  - mention UNIX/Win32 compatiability in docs
    (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16501)
  - detect page corruption better and croak rather than segfault
    (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=17335)
  - when running in raw_values => 0 mode, always store
    reference to data. Storable doesn't like freeze(SCALAR)
    (http://rt.cpan.org/Ticket/Display.html?id=16762)
  - Handle edge case of slot count increase when page
    already nearly full possibly causing corruption
    (can only happen if ->purge() called at just the wrong time)

1.12  Thu Oct 19 09:50 2006
  - allow writing into a deleted slot

1.11  Web Oct 18 15:10 2006
  - allow setting default slot count via start_slots argument

1.10  Web Oct 18 14:50 2006
  - fc_lock() would segfault if no slots were available.
    Doesn't happen in normal usage, but can happen if
    cache behaviour altered by alternate code

1.09  Thu Feb  7 15:50 2005
  - add get_and_set() routine to allow atomic reading and
    writing of a cache value (thanks to Sreeji Das)
  - fix some tests
